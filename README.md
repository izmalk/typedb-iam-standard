## TypeDB's Simulation and Benchmarking Library

TypeDB Simulation is a library built to enable the creation of real-world simulations for [TypeDB](https://github.com/vaticle/typedb). This makes it easy to showcase schemas built for real-life use cases and industry examples. TypeDB Simulation is generic, not bound to any one DBMS or any one use case. Besides running simulations, it can also be used to benchmark supported database systems and perform comparisons.

Currently, TypeDB Simulation supports running TypeDB, TypeDB Cluster, and Neo4j. More databases will be added in the future.

Reasoning query benchmarks are supported for TypeDB and TypeDB Cluster, but cannot be used in comparison tests.
